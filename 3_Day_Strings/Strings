Strings - Sequence of characters/unicodes
Unicodes - how string stores the data internally (in the form of 0's and 1's)
For multiline strings we will be using triple quotes.
s = '''Hi my name is Robin
             I am from Himachal'''
    Hi my name is Robin\n I am from Himachal
Strings are imutable
we can not append string and integer
